Create your own inline buttons :) [Available Language : EN/FA]

# How to install
<b>1.</b> Upload the source into your host
Like this directory : <code>/public_html/glassy</code><br />

<b>2.</b> Now we edit <code>bot.php</code><br />
Put your token in line 4.<br />
You need to change '123456789:MSX15Awesome' to your own bot's token.<br />
Next you should put your bot's username[WITHOUT @] in line 5, instead of "MyGlassyBot".<br />
Then you have to put your bot's ID in line 6, instead of "123456789".<br />
Now you're done with your bot's config.<br />

<b>3.</b> Now you should setwebhook, <br />
You can setwebhook with clicking this kind of link:<br />
<code>https://api.telegram.org/bot[TOKEN]/setwebook?url=[LINK2BOT.PHP]</code><br />
but you must change:<br />
[TOKEN] => to your token,<br />
[LINK2BOT.PHP] => to your bot.php address<i>(address should start with https://</i>)<br /><br />

For Example :<br />
I run this link in my browser :<br />
<code>https://api.telegram.org/bot123456789:MSX15Awesome/setwebook?url=https://msxtm.ir/glassy/bot.php</code>
